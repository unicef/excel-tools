This Cost & Modeling Spreadsheet (CosMoS) was specifically developed to simplify and facilitate costing for education in emergency or informal education contexts. It is useful if:

- You need to develop an education sector budget quickly and as accurately as possible
- Develop budgets for proposals (especially multiple similar proposals, as you can easily tweak it once it has been set up)
- Modeling planned interventions and improvements and immediately seeing the impact in terms of total cost and cost per child

The budget which is normally in one sheet, is broken into several sheets:

1. Unit costs
2. Key inputs - Baseline and target figures need to be inserted here to calculate the required number of schools, teachers, etc.
3. Ratios - Based on standards (e.g. pupil-classroom ratio) and assumptions (e.g. teacher attrition rate). This is a new element not typically found in budget templates which allows for modeling costs automatically based on provided inputs.
4. Budget - The detailed budget (and budget model), using inputs from the above three sheets.
5. Summary - Automatically generated budget summary with option to generate a standard budget spreadsheet

Note: all data in the spreadsheet are fictional, for demonstration purposes only.
